    <div class="instructions">
        <h1>Exercise routine</h1>
        <p>We take the dogs on either 2 short walks a day or 1 long walk</p>
        <p>Don't walk them straight after they've had a meal if possible, there's a small chance this can make them ill</p>
        <p>If Luna starts limping on her front left paw, don't worry it's a recurring corn and we will sort it when we get her home, she can go without the walks if she's limping a lot</p>
        <p>Luna should stay on the lead on walks or in non-enclosed areas</p>

        <h1>Toilet routine</h1>
        <p>There are poo bags on the lead for when you're walking, -note: these are for the dogs-</p>  
        <p>We tend to let them out into our garden at least every 4 hours in the day, close the door and let them mooch about for 5 mins</p>
        <p>If there is an accident, there is a cleaner in their bag, follow instructions on that</p>
