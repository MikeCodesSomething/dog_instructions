        <h1>Special skills</h1>
        <p>Here are the girly's special skills</p>
        <ul> Both:
            <li>"Paw" - and put your hand out for a cute hi-five</li>
            <li>"Lie down" - Nymmy will lie straight down wherever she is, Luna will want to find somewhere comfy</li>
            <li>"Off" - tells them to leave whatever they're trying to get, this is normally food of some description, not 100% effective</li>
            <li>"[name] Come" - Nym will basically always come, Luna if she is feeling the vibe, bribe by saying "want a Treat" if it's important</li>
            <li>"Stay" - best when they are lying or sitting, once again Luna is not so great at this ...yet </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Nym:
            <li>"Sit" see photo above, Luna is too bony to sit</li>
            <li>"Roll Over" - self explanatory, but she needs to be lying down first</li>
            <li>"Up" - she'll jump up</li>            
            <li>"Twirl" - after up she'll do a little spin, but we don't normally make her do this one much as it's a young dogs game</li>            
        </ul>
