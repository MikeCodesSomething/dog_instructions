        <h1>It's ok, she does this.. a lot, here's what you do</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't panic, it's almost certainly fine</li>
            <li>If she hasn't finished eating it and you think it's dangerous, try and get her to stop.. obviously </li>
            <li>Google how bad the bad thing is for her, unless it's poison or a lot of dark chocolate/sugarfree gum, she probably won't need to see the vet</li>
            <li>Let us know on WhatsApp, she's probably eaten whatever it is before</li>
            <li>If you can't get through to us, or google tells you to, call her vet Medivet in harrogate: 01423 884074, they'll know what to do and if they are closed there will be an emergency number either in their message or just by googling</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Something else is up with one of the dogs</h1>
        <p>In the rare case that this might happen, no need to panic once again, try and let us know on WhatsApp, if you can't get through to us and it seems really serious call her vet Medivet in harrogate: 01423 884074</p>
