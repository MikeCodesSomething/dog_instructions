        <h1>Meal routine</h1>
        <p>These girls love to eat dinner, here's their normal routine</p>
        <ul> Both:
            <li>Dentastick in the morning whenever you get up, (they know what is coming and will be excited) give it to them once they are outside and leave them out for a bit</li>
            <li>They drink when they feel like it (Nymmy can usually find her bowl but might need a bit of help the first time in a new place), just make sure their bowls have water</li>
            <li>Snacks whenever you like, they are very useful for bribing them to do things, for example: getting off furniture</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Nym:
            <li>Breakfast after dentastick, 1 of the tupperware containers of food</li>
            <li>Dinner at 6pm, 1 of the tupperwear containers of food</li>            
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Luna:
            <li>Luna needs to eat her food and water (apart from dentastick) from higher up using the bowl stand</li>
            <li>Breakfast after dentastick, 1 of the tupperware containers of food and 1 mugfull of biscuits (the mug is in the bag of biscuits)</li>
            <li> Dinner at 6pm, 1 of the tupperware containers of food and 1 mugfull of biscuits</li>
        
        </ul>
        </ul>
